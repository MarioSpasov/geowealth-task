The project structure is simple. Main folder is /src.

It consists:

./components - Here are all reusable components

./features - Here is only one component - for Dashboard with has his own path in App.js

./hooks - Here are project custtom hooks. So far there are two - for fetching data for US states and for fetching data for github users

./store - Here is state managment store - so far is only for users preferences. I keep them in local storage as well but best option is to store them on server as well.

./types - Here are most of interfaces and enums that are used in the project.

./utils - Here are some custom functions which could be reused
